#WorkoutFrontend

The main purpose of this workout app is to help people with their exercises by providing features such as calorie management and diet tracking.

The platform uses React Typescript as a frontend with Vanilla CSS and Tailwind CSS, while the backend is written in Node JS with Express. In order to have an efficient and usable application, it stores all data in a MongoDB database.

The deployment of the platform is planned.

This repo contains the frontend part of the platform.
